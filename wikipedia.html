                Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.As of November 2024, Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are supported as long-term support (LTS) versions, with Java 25, releasing in September 2025, as the next scheduled LTS version.

    <h1><b> About </b></h1>

    <p1 style="font-size: x-large; color: darkgoldenrod;">In Java, <b style="font-size: x-large;">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) </b>is a programming style that organizes code into objects, which combine data and methods. It is built on four key principles: Encapsulation means bundling variables and methods inside a class and controlling access to them; Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behavior of another, promoting code reusability; Polymorphism enables methods to perform differently based on the object that calls them, through method overloading and overriding; and Abstraction hides the internal implementation details while exposing only the essential functionality using abstract classes or interfaces. Together, these principles make Java programs more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</p1>
